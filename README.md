This report will investigate predicting the genre of a song based on music features. The song genres to be classified are Electronic, Experimental, Folk, Hip-Hop, Instrumental, International, Pop or Rock. 
The objective is to construct a classifier which, based on the features of a song, predicts its genre, and to estimates its generalisation error under the 0â€“1 loss. 

Various baseline classification techniques are considered, including Logistic Regression, Random Forests, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines for this purpose. 
Ensemble stacking of several base models is studied. As an extension, we propose to apply bootstrapping to SVM which turns out to improve the testing accuracy.
